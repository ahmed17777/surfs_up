## Overview 

This project was about performing a statistical analysis that explores measures of central tendency and percentile ranks for temperature data in Oahu, Hawaii using SQLAlchemy and Python. This analysis will deteremine if the surf and ice cream shop businesses is suitable in this region year-round. 

## Results 
The following are the results of my analysis: 

- For the month of June, we have an average temp of 75°F, with a min of 64°F and max of 85°F as shown by the table below

- For the month of December, our average temp is 71°F, a min of 56°F and max of 83°F

- As we can see the difference in standard deviations for the two seasons is approximately .5 (3.25 in June and 3.75 in December)

## Summary 

What our results show us is that it is quite feasible to have the surf and ice cream shops in this region, as our difference in standard deviation of temperature is only .5, which is not significant for weather to have an affect on these businesses. Our min from both seasons is 56°F and max is 85°F, which is quite suitable for this type of business. Although this information is useful for making this decision, some further analysis would help our decision further. Some queries we could perform to help this decision include: analysis on measures of central tendency and percentiles for spring and autumn, an analysis of outliers in rainfall data, and perhaps looking at any other weather events that may take place in this region.
